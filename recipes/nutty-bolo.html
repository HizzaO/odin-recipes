    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g vegan spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 red onions</li>
        <li>2 carrots</li>
        <li>100g celeriac</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>12 pitted kalamata olives</li>
        <li>100g walnut kernels</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>200ml vegtable broth</li>
        <li>2 cans of chunky tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of sweet paprika powder</li>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>black pepper</li>
        <li>half a bunch of basil</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the onions, carrots, and celery and dice into small cubes of about 5 mm.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan and sauté the diced vegetables over medium heat for about 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, roughly chop the olives and walnuts. Add both to the vegetables in the pan and sauté for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the garlic, then stir in together with the tomato paste and sugar. Fry over a high heat for 1 minute until lightly caramelized.</li>
        <li>Stir in the vegetable broth, canned tomatoes, oregano, thyme, paprika, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer over medium heat for about 15 minutes. Stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, bring salted water to a boil in a large pot and cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Rinse the basil, shake dry, and roughly tear the leaves.</li>
        <li>After the sauce has cooked, remove the spaghetti from the boiling water, add it to the pan while still wet, and mix it into the Bolognese sauce.</li>
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper, adding a little pasta cooking water if necessary to make everything a little silkier.</li>
        <li>Fold in the basil and serve the Bolognese spaghetti in deep plates. Drizzle with a few drops of olive oil and top with freshly ground pepper to taste.</li>

    </ol>
